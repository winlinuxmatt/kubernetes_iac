Terraform Kubernetes IAC

This repository was constructed by following the instructions outlined in the enlightening article mentioned below. I have made certain modifications to adapt it to my specific cluster configuration. It is worth noting that the datasets or datastores on my proxmox might have different names compared to those in your proxmox setup. Therefore, it is essential to make the necessary adjustments according to your own setup. My proxmox cluster consists of three nodes and utilizes the ceph storage solution for efficient management of virtual machines across all nodes.

## Additional Steps

After setting up the cluster, there are a few additional steps that may be helpful to others.

### Connect to the Talos Kubernetes Cluster

To connect to your Talos Kubernetes cluster using the outputs from Terraform, you need to set up your local environment with the correct configuration files. Follow these steps:

1. Save the `kubeconfig` and `talosconfig` outputs to files on your local machine. Run the following commands:

	```bash
	terraform output -raw kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config && terraform output -raw talosconfig > ~/.talos/config
	```

	Note: Adjust the file paths if necessary.

2. Verify the file permissions for these files to avoid any security issues:

	```bash
	chmod 600 ~/.kube/config && chmod 600 ~/.talos/config
	```

### Set Up kubectl

To interact with the Kubernetes cluster, you can use `kubectl`. Here's an example command to get the list of nodes:

```
terraform output -raw kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config && terraform output -raw talosconfig > ~/.talos/config
```

This assumes you have ~/.kube/config and ~/.talos/config as the default locations for Kubernetes and Talos configurations. Adjust the file paths if necessary.
Verify File Permissions
Ensure the permissions for these files are set correctly to avoid any security issues:

```
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config && chmod 600 ~/.talos/config
```

Or you can do it all in one

```
terraform output -raw kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config && terraform output -raw talosconfig > ~/.talos/config && chmod 600 ~/.kube/config && chmod 600 ~/.talos/config
```

Set Up kubectl
Get the list of nodes

```
kubectl get nodes

talos-worker-03   Ready    <none>          3h24m   v1.30.0
```
Show the dashboard of one of the nodes via

```
talosctl dashboard -n talos-cp-01
```
Check the Health

```
talosctl -n talos-cp-01 health                                                                                                                        1 â†µ
